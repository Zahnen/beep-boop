# _Beep Boop Bot_

#### _A webpage that will respond to user input with "beeps" and "boops", October 23, 2020_

#### By _**Zahnen Garner**_

## Description

_This webpage was created as my independent project for my third week at Epicodus. The webpage allows users to enter a numerical input and receive back a count up to that input from a robofriend. Sometimes our robofriend gets confused and replaces certain values with "beeps" or "boops" The webpage was created to apply concepts I learned this week including looping and modifying arrays._
